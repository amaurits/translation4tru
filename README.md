# translation4tru: Translation for the rest of us
## word-level translation dictionaries for free, fast, decent quality translation.

Automated machine translation has been improving in quality rapidly for some years, and now approaches that of professional human translation. However, for large volume translations, these methods remain costly, in terms of money, computational resources, or time. In contrast, word-level translation is both free and fast, simply mapping each word in a source language deterministically to a target language. While the resulting translations are ungainly, for many text analysis methods this is not a problem.

This repository makes available translation dictionaries for a number languages (at the moment, only European languages). For each language pair, there is a dictionary file (with lines of the form `<source word>,<target word>`) and an associated translation code file (with lines of the form `<source word> <translation code>`). The translation dictionaries are generated from aligned embeddings, applying a number of heuristics to improve the translation quality. The translation codes indicate which heuristics were used to generate the translation. 
  
A simple Jupyter notebook is supplied to translate texts from a source to a target language using one of these dictionaries, but using the notebook is not a requirement to use the dictionaries. 
  
The accompanying paper provides more infornation about the process generating the dictionaries, along with validation tests establishing their usability for standard text analysis purposes.
